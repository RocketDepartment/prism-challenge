Prism Challenge
========================

An interactive laser maze project using Arduino and Raspberry Pi. Players are timed as they navigate through the maze. When a laser it broken a penality is recorded. 

### Background ###
This project was orginally created for TBD Fest 2014, a 3 day music festival in West Sacramento, CA. Our team of 5 Makers constructed the project insides a 10ft x 40fx shipping container. Players had to navigate through the maze, 'steal' the glowing orb, and make their way back to the entrace as quickly as possible without breaking any lasers. 

Next stop is taking our project to Maker Faire Bay Area 2015 (May 16th & May 17th)

### Components ###
- Arduino Mega
- Raspberry Pi
- 8 Lasers
- 8 Laser Sensors (Photocell)
- Glowing Orb (LED Dog Toy)
- Custom Laser Control Unit (LCU): a laser cut electronics box that holds Pi and Arduino with buttons and indictor lights for controlling the game
